\title{Add similarity flag value to a \code{simfit} object}
\usage{
similarity_flag(track, sim_track, flag = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{track}{a dataframe containing longitude and latitudes of the observed
path used in the SSM fit}

\item{sim_track}{a dataframe containing the longitude and latitude of a single
simulated path from simfit}

\item{flag}{set to either 1 or 2 to define similarity index (see details)}
}
\value{
a single value representing the similarity in distance and bearing between the two paths
}
\description{
Calculate the similarity between a single path generated by simfit and the
observed path used in the SSM fit. Similarity flag values are based on two interpretations
of the difference in distance and bearing between the two paths.
}
\details{
\code{flag = 1} will use an index based on Hazen (2017)\cr
\code{flag = 2} (the default) will use a custom index
