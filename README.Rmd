`{foieGras}` is an R package that fits continuous-time models in state-space form to filter error-prone animal movement data obtained via the Argos satellite system, and to estimate changes in movement behaviour. Template Model Builder {TMB} is used for fast estimation. Argos data can be either (older) Least Squares-based locations, (newer) Kalman Filter-based locations with error ellipse information, or a mixture of the two. The state-space models estimate two sets of location states: 1) corresponding to each observation, which are usually irregularly timed (fitted states); and 2) corresponding to (usually) regular time intervals specified by the user (predicted states). Locations are returned as both LongLat and on the Mercator projection (units=km). The models may be applied with appropriate caution to tracking data obtained from other systems, such as light-level geolocations and GPS. 

## Installation 
First, ensure you have R version >= 3.6.0 installed (preferably R 4.1.0 or higher):

```{r get-version, eval = FALSE}
R.Version()
```

### From R-Universe
As of `v1.0-5`, `{foieGras}` is available via R-Universe. This is where the latest stable version can always be found. Installation is simple:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install from my R-universe repository
install.packages("foieGras", 
                 repos = "https://ianjonsen.r-universe.dev")

```
However, this will not install any of `{foieGras}`'s Suggested packages, which add extra functionality such as path re-routing around land. To ensure all Suggested packages, either from R-Universe or CRAN are also installed:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("foieGras", 
                 repos = c("https://cloud.r-project.org",
                           "https://ianjonsen.r-universe.dev"),
                 dependencies = "Suggests")
```
`install.packages` will tell you that both a binary (CRAN, v0.7-6) and a source (R-Universe, v1.0-5) version exist but the source version is newer. Answer `Yes` to install the source version, provided you have the appropriate compiler tools available (See **From GitHub (source)**, below). 

To avoid doing the above every time you want to re-install `{foieGras}`, you can add my R-Universe repo to your local list of repositories for package download in your `.Rprofile`. This ensures `install.packages` automatically grabs the latest version of `{foieGras}`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("usethis")
usethis::edit_r_profile()

# add the following text or replace existing repos option
options(repos = c(ianjonsen = 'https://ianjonsen.r-universe.dev',
                  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

If you don't want to install compiler tools or have trouble getting them to work then you can manually download a binary version of the `{foieGras}` package for Windows or Mac from here https://ianjonsen.r-universe.dev/ui#builds - click the Windows/Mac icons (either R 4.2 or 4.1) on the table line corresponding to `{foieGras}`, and choose the appropriate `-release` version from the bottom of the page. In R, use the following command to install from the file you've just downloaded (where `path_to_file` is wherever you saved the download:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# for Windows
install.packages("path_to_file\package-windows-release\foieGras_1.0-5.zip", 
                 repos=NULL, type="binary")

# for Mac
install.packages("path_to_file/package-macos-release/foieGras_1.0-5.tgz", 
                 repos=NULL, type="binary")

```


### From CRAN  
`{foieGras}` `v0.7-6` is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foieGras/) and can be downloaded within `R`, in the usual way `install.packages("foieGras")` or, more completely: `install.packages("foieGras", depedencies = c("Imports","LinkingTo","Suggests"))`. {foieGras} `v1.0-5` probably won't become available on CRAN.


### From GitHub (source)  
To get the very latest but likely unstable `{foieGras}` version, you can install from GitHub. 

On PC's running Windows, ensure you have installed [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) 

On Mac's, ensure you have installed the Command Line Tools for Xcode by executing `xcode-select --install` in the terminal; or you can download the latest version from the URL (free developer registration may be required). A full Xcode install uses up a lot of disk space and is not required. Also, ensure you have a suitable Gnu Fortran compiler installed (e.g., https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases).

```{r gh-installation_staging, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ianjonsen/foieGras@staging")
```

Note: there can be issues getting compilers to work properly, especially on M1 Macs. Often, this is due to missing or incorrect Xcode Command Line Tools and/or Fortran compiler. If you encounter install and compile issues, you may find a solution in the excellent documentation here [glmmTMB](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB). Alternatively, if you don't care to have the very latest version then installing from R-Universe is the preferred approach. R-Universe automatically builds binary package versions for all common platforms, so you won't have to worry about compiler software or issues!


## Usage
`{foieGras}` is intended to be as easy to use as possible. Here's a simple example showing how to fit a move persistence model to Argos tracking data and visualise the result:
```{r example1, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.dim=c(9,4), out.width="100%"}
library(foieGras)

fit <- fit_ssm(sese, 
               vmax= 4, 
               model = "mp", 
               time.step = 24, 
               control = ssm_control(verbose = 0))

plot(fit, type = 3, pages = 1, ncol = 2)
```

```{r ex1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.dim=c(9,4), out.width="100%"}
library(foieGras)
load("misc/fit.rda")
plot(fit, type = 3, pages = 1, ncol = 2)
```


```{r example2, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
map(fit, 
    what = "predicted", 
    normalise = TRUE,
    crs = "+proj=stere +lon_0=68 +units=km +datum=WGS84")
```

```{r explots2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.dim=c(9,5), out.width="100%"}
m <- map(fit, 
         what = "predicted", 
         crs = "+proj=stere +lon_0=68 +units=km +datum=WGS84",
         silent = TRUE)

require(cowplot)
## using cowplot to add southern elephant seal silhouettes to map

  draw_image("inst/logo/img/sese_male_orig.png",  x=0.85, y=0.35, scale=0.25, hjust=0.5, vjust=0.5)

## What to do if you encounter a problem
If you are convinced you have encountered a bug or unexpected/inconsistent behaviour when using `{foieGras}`, you can post an issue [here](https://github.com/ianjonsen/foieGras/issues). First, have a read through the posted issues to see if others have encountered the same problem and whether a solution has been offered. You can reply to an existing issue if you have the same problem and have more details to share or you can submit a new issue. To submit an issue, you will need to _clearly_ describe the unexpected behaviour, include a reproducible example with a small dataset, clearly describe what you expected to happen (but didn't), and (ideally) post a few screenshots/images that nicely illustrate the problem.

## How to Contribute
Contributions from anyone in the Movement Ecology/Bio-Logging communities are welcome. Consider submitting a feature request [here](https://github.com/ianjonsen/foieGras/issues/new/choose) to start a discussion. Alternatively, if your idea is well-developed then you can submit a pull request for evaluation [here](https://github.com/ianjonsen/foieGras/pulls). Unsure about what all this means but still want to discuss your idea? then have a look through the GitHub pages of community-built R packages like [tidyverse/dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) for examples.
